This is my portfolio; not sure what kind of work I plan on putting here! A mix of interests from math, video games, maybe [mathematical] music analysis, and other stuff!

Also, this proof (and definition of limits/derivative and resultant proofs for specific functions) haunt me 

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

hopefully will edit this before I submit something and make it look way better (9/3/2024)
